            <h1>What We Taught?</h1>
            <p> To be accountable for ourselves as the results we see are directly correlated to the effort and dedication we have applied over time. Our bodies don't give us a free pass to results if we make excuses to skip training or don't give total effort in our workouts. <br>
            In addition to improving physical health, going to a gym can also enhance mental health. Exercise has been proven to alleviate stress, boost mood, and enable greater sleep.</p>
